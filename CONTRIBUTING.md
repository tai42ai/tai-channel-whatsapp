# Contributing to tai42-channel-whatsapp-cloud

`tai42-channel-whatsapp-cloud` is a Meta WhatsApp Cloud API **channel** plugin for
the TAI ecosystem: `ask_user(..., channel="whatsapp-cloud")` delivers the question
to a human on WhatsApp and bridges the reply back to the interaction's public
callback door. It implements the `tai42_contract.channels.Channel` protocol. The
hard rule (the plugin rule): **it depends on `tai42-contract` + `tai42-kit` only
and never imports the skeleton.** The skeleton loads it through the manifest's
`channel_modules` field; `tai42_channel_whatsapp_cloud.register` registers the
`"whatsapp-cloud"` channel and its inbound route as a side-effect — there is no
import edge to the skeleton in either direction.

## Ground rules

- **No skeleton import — ever.** The package is contract-facing; the ban is
  enforced by ruff (`flake8-tidy-imports`), so a stray import fails lint:
  ```bash
  grep -rn "tai42_skeleton" src/   # must be empty
  ```
- **Credentials are operator-bound, never LLM-visible.** The Graph access token,
  app secret, verify token, and sender/recipient configuration come from the
  environment, never from a tool parameter.
- **Fail closed.** A delivery or inbound event against an unconfigured channel
  raises loudly, naming the missing env var; the inbound door validates the
  request signature before accepting a reply.
- **Typed package** (`py.typed`). Pyright runs clean.

## Layout

- `register.py` — registers the `"whatsapp-cloud"` channel and the inbound route
  as an import side-effect.
- `channel.py` — the outbound `Channel` implementation (WhatsApp text).
- `inbound.py` — the inbound door: GET verification, POST message + delivery-status
  webhooks, bridging the reply back to the callback.
- `client.py`, `correlation.py`, `settings.py` — the HTTP client, the Redis
  correlation store, and the `CHANNEL_WHATSAPP_CLOUD_` settings.

## Naming

PyPI is a flat namespace with no owner in the path, so distributions carry the
`tai42-` prefix. GitHub repositories keep their `tai-` names, because the
`tai42ai` organisation already namespaces them. Import packages follow the
distribution.

| Surface | Form |
| --- | --- |
| Distribution — PyPI, `pip install`, dependency pins | `tai42-<name>` |
| Import package | `tai42_<name>` |
| GitHub repository and sibling checkout directory | `tai-<name>` |

So a dependency is declared as `tai42-<name>` but resolved from `../tai-<name>`
during local development, and both spellings are correct in their own context.

Some surfaces are deliberately neither, and must not be renamed: the `tai` CLI
command (`tai42` is an alias), the Prometheus metric namespace (`tai_tool_*`),
`TAI_*` environment variables, and the `tai-plugin.yml` descriptor filename.

## Dev

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pyright
```

For local cross-repo work, `make dev` editable-installs the sibling `tai-*`
checkouts this package builds on into the venv. While `[tool.uv.sources]` pins
those siblings to local paths, `uv sync` already installs them editable and
`make dev` changes nothing; once the lock resolves them from the registry,
`uv sync` / `uv run` installs the published builds instead, so re-run
`make dev` afterward to restore the editable links.

Before any commit, run a secret scan over `src/` and `tests/` (e.g.
`detect-secrets scan`).
